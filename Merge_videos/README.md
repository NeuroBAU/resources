# Merge_videos
Mediarecorder (Noldus) may output separate video, instead of merged videos, if the user forgets to select the "picture by picture" option.

### Rename files
Both Mediarecorder and Ethovision save videos with filenames containing (A LOT OF) white spaces. It is mandatory to replace whitespaces with underscore ('_')

### merge videos (side by side)
place the two videos side by side (frame by frame)
