# Processing - Arduino TTL connection

1. activate serial communication on Processing
2. set processing to send value to com port (either 0 or 1)
3. load script on arduino to read from serial port
4. set condition on Arduino script on calue read from the serial port (if ==1, then. if == 0 then ...)
5. all pins on arduino can be used since the output is 5 V
